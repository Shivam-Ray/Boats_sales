Analysed and did EDA for a Newsletter to increase the Viewership of the Company

The newsletter is designed to help sellers to get more views of their boat, as well as
stay on top of market trends. 

The goal is to increase the number of readers by 75% this year.

I analysed the recent data and learnt more about the characteristics of the most 
viewed boat listings in the last 7 days - 

Q1 ) Is it the most expensive boats that get the most views?

Q2 ) Are there common features among the most viewed boats?

Q3 ) Which location attracts more viewers to target the newsletter at specific places ?

Q4 ) Statistical Analysis of the listings of the Boats
